# flappy_birb

## Reasons

Well, I decided to do it because I'm paralyzed from the neck down and I can no longer move it move it.

## Basic Concept

A Flappy bird - Geometry dash type of game. Some Pipes are portals and if you go through them, physics change,
and you, for Example get to play the "real" Geometry Dash. The Possibilities are endless.

## Libraries used

I use pygame as a Rendering Engine and random to set the pylon heights at random heights. Time is used for keeping a
constant rendering time.

## TODO

* add Menu
* add high score **in dev**
